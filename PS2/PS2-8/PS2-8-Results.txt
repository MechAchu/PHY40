The answer we get is 0.140386


Looking at the behavior of each term individually we see that x^0.34 rises very
slowly, e^0.25*x also rises slowly until x goes past 4, sin(x) must fluctuate
between -1 <= x <= 1, 1/2.2+9*sqrt(x) decreases fairly slowly. So then Looking
at this we know that the sin(x) must go from positive to negative, and with
the multiples the numerator must be less than 1, and dividing by the denominator
we know that the answer we get from the numerator must be divided even smaller,
so for x = 1 we get approximately 1/2. So this means that the amplitude can't be
greater than 0.75 for our domain, so the integral must be less than 1.
