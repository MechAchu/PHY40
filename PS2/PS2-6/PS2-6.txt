Using the integral rules the definite integral of x^2 is 39, so the trapezoidal
rule is always closer to the actual definite integral, and is better for that
reason. The reason the trapezoidal rule is better is because it is the average
of the left and right sums, and is better able to accommodate the curve than an
individual rectangle whose corner touches the curve. If you look at a diagram
of using the trapezoidal rule we see that due to it being the average of the left
and right sums we are able to accompany parts of the area where it may be an
underapproximation or an over-approximation if we were to use rectangles.
