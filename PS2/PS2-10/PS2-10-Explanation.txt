This makes sense because at the beginning of the simulation the spring is 5m off
of equilibrium, so it must compensate for this by going backwards which is a
negative velocity.

The second part makes sense because at the equilibrium point the object will
have it's maximum kinetic energy and is currently moving backwards which is why
it has a negative velocity. Then after this the velocity starts going to 0 as
the object gets to x = -5. As this is the point the object wants to go back to
equilibrium and must gain a positive velocity.
