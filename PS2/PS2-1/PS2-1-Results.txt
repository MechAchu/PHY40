For x = 3.0 and dx = 0.1, we get df/dx = 6.100
For x = 3.0 and dx = 0.01, we get df/dx = 6.010
For x = 3.0 and dx = 0.001, we get df/dx = 6.001

So basically what the code does is takes a value of x, puts that into the
myfunction where it's x^2. Then it takes the value of x puts that into
myfunction and adds it to dx. Then the derivative is calculated by doing
myfunction(x+dx) - myfunction(x) / dx. This is a direct copy from the limit
definition of a derivative. Where myfunction(x+dx) = f(x+dx) and myfunction(x) =
f(x).
