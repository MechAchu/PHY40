It makes sense because the spring is 5 units away from the equilibrium so it
wants to go backwards so as it gains a negative velocity it goes to zero from
5.

It makes sense because the spring has a large enough velocity that it overshoots
the equilibrium point and is going behind the equilibrium position.
